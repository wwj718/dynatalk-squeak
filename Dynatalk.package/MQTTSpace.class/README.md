I am responsible for sending and receiving messages and understand the details of the message transmission (MQTT), but I do not understand the content of the message. Whenever I receive a message, I will forward it to the supervisor

depend on MQTTClient(https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/63), install it:  
	(Installer repository: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/MQTTClient' ) install: 'MQTT-tpr.25.mcz'
